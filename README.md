# mdn-core-html
I'm focused on mastering the fundamentals of web development, starting with HTML as my foundation. This repository tracks my progress through Mozilla's MDN curriculum as I build a solid understanding of core web technologies.

My goal is to thoroughly understand each language before moving forward - no shortcuts, just proper fundamentals that will serve me well as I advance in web development.
