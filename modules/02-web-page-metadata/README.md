# HTML Head: The Brains of the Web Page üß†

The `<head>` is the part of an HTML document that isn't displayed on the page. It acts as a container for **metadata**‚Äîdata about the page itself. Browsers use this information to render the page correctly.

-----

## üëë Adding a Title: `<title>`

  * The `<title>` element defines the title of the **overall HTML document**. It's different from the `<h1>` element, which is the main heading visible on the page.

  * **Where it appears:**

      * Browser tabs
      * Bookmark names
      * Search engine results

  * **Example:**

    ```html
    <head>
      <title>My Awesome Web Page</title>
    </head>
    ```

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Metadata: The `<meta>` Element

The `<meta>` element is used to specify metadata that can't be expressed by other HTML elements.

### Character Encoding

This is crucial for ensuring your page displays text and symbols from any language correctly. Always use `utf-8`.

  * **Code:** `<meta charset="utf-8" />`

### Author & Description

This information helps with **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)** and provides context.

  * **Author:** Lets people know who created the page.
      * **Code:** `<meta name="author" content="Your Name" />`
  * **Description:** A brief summary of the page's content. Search engines often use this in their results.
      * **Code:** `<meta name="description" content="A concise summary of my page content." />`

-----

## ‚≠ê Custom Icons: Favicons

A **favicon** (favorites icon) is a small icon that appears in browser tabs, bookmarks, and on mobile device home screens.

  * Add it to your `<head>` using a `<link>` tag.

  * While `.ico` is the traditional format, modern browsers also support `.png` and `.gif`.

  * **Basic Example:**

    ```html
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon" />
    ```

  * **Apple Touch Icon Example:**

    ```html
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/apple-touch-icon.png" />
    ```

## üé® Applying CSS & JavaScript ‚öôÔ∏è

The `<head>` is where you typically link to your external stylesheets and scripts.

### Linking CSS

Use the `<link>` element to apply styles to your HTML.

  * **Code:** `<link rel="stylesheet" href="my-styles.css" />`

### Linking JavaScript

Use the `<script>` element to add interactivity. Using the `defer` attribute is the most reliable modern method.

  * **Why `defer`?** It tells the browser to finish loading the HTML *before* running the script, which prevents errors.
  * **Code:** `<script src="my-script.js" defer></script>`

## üåê Setting the Document Language

You should always declare the primary language of the document using the `lang` attribute in the opening `<html>` tag.

  * **Importance:**

      * Helps **search engines** index your page correctly for language-specific results.
      * Crucial for **accessibility**, as it allows screen readers to use the correct pronunciation.

  * **Example:**

    ```html
    <html lang="en-US">
    ...
    </html>
    ```
