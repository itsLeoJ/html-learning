## Challenge: Structuring a planet data table 🪐
---
This challenge provides data on solar system planets and asks you to structure it into an accessible HTML table.

### Starting Point 🚀
---
* Make local copies of **blank-template.html**, **minimal-table.css**, and **planets-data.txt**.
* You can use your code editor or an online editor like CodePen or JSFiddle.
* If you get stuck, you can get help through MDN's communication channels.

### Project Brief 📋
---
* Your goal is to turn raw planet data into an easy-to-follow HTML data table for students.

### Steps to Complete 🛠️
---
1.  Open **blank-template.html** and create the basic table structure: an outer container, a `<thead>`, and a `<tbody>`.
2.  Add a `<caption>` to the table.
3.  Add a row to the `<thead>` with all the column headers.
4.  Create content rows in the `<tbody>`, making sure to semantically mark all row headings.
5.  Place all data in the correct cells.
6.  Add attributes to associate row and column headers with their respective rows, columns, or row groups.
7.  Add a black border around the column containing the planet names.

### Hints and Tips 💡
---
* The first cell in the header row should be blank and span two columns.
* Group row headings (e.g., Jovian planets) need to span the correct number of rows and columns.
* One method of associating headers is easier than the other.
