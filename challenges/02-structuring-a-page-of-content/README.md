## Starting Point 🚀
---
To begin, download the zip file containing all the necessary assets:
- HTML file for adding structural markup.
- CSS file for styling.
- Images for the page.

You can either create the example on your local computer or use an online editor like CodePen or JSFiddle.

## Project Brief 📝
---
Your task is to add structural elements to the homepage content of a bird watching website. The page needs to have:

- A full-width **header** with the page title, site logo, and navigation menu. The title and logo will be side by side, with the navigation below.
- A **main content area** with two columns: a main block for welcome text and a sidebar for image thumbnails.
- A **footer** with copyright information and credits.

You need to add wrappers for:
- The header
- The navigation menu
- The main content
- The welcome text
- The image sidebar
- The footer

Also, apply the provided CSS by adding a `<link>` element just below the existing one.

## Hints and Tips💡
---
- Use the **W3C Nu HTML Checker** to find and fix mistakes in your HTML, CSS, and SVG.
- You don't need CSS knowledge; just add the provided CSS inside an HTML element.
- The provided CSS will turn the correct structural elements green on the rendered page.
- If you're stuck, draw a simple block diagram of the page layout and label the wrapping elements you think are needed.
